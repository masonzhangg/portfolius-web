            Portfolius Inc. is not a registered investment adviser,
            broker-dealer, or financial services provider. The platform is a
            **social trading simulation** designed to help users engage with
            market trends, explore investment concepts, and share simulated
            trades with friends. All transactions on Portfolius are conducted
            using **virtual money** and do not involve real financial assets.
            Users should not interpret any information, discussions, or shared
            trades as professional financial advice or investment
            recommendations.

            <br />
            <strong>Social Trading and Simulation-Based Learning</strong> <br />
            Portfolius is a **community-driven trading simulation platform**,
            where users can track virtual stock market movements, engage in
            simulated trading, and see how their friends navigate market
            conditions. The platform enables users to follow, discuss, and
            compare trading strategies in a **risk-free, virtual environment**.
            While users may exchange insights, ideas, and strategies, all
            interactions should be considered **educational and for
            entertainment purposes only**.
            <br />
            <br />
            **No real financial transactions take place on Portfolius.** Users
            cannot deposit or withdraw real money, nor can they purchase actual
            stocks or securities through the platform. Any trades, portfolio
            performance, or rankings on Portfolius **do not reflect real-world
            market conditions, brokerage fees, or actual investment
            performance**.

            <br />
            <strong>Investment Risks and Limitations</strong> <br />
            Investing in real-world securities involves significant risk,
            including the potential loss of capital. While Portfolius offers
            simulated trading based on real market data, **past performance in
            the simulation does not guarantee success in real-world investing**.
            Users should not base any actual investment decisions on their
            simulated trades, social insights, or leaderboard rankings.
            <br />
            <br />
            The platform does not provide personalized financial guidance, and
            users should conduct their own due diligence before making real
            investments. Market conditions are **unpredictable and subject to
            change**, and information available on Portfolius may not be up to

            all opinions, discussions, and trade-sharing within the platform

            <strong>Consult with Financial Professionals</strong> <br />
            If you are considering making real-world investments, you should
            consult with a **licensed financial advisor, tax professional, or
            legal expert**. Portfolius does not provide personalized investment
